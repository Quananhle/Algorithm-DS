When you run the application you will be greeted with a menu system. You have the following customisations:
### Array Options
- **Array field**  - You can enter a comma separated list of integers.
- **Array Size** - This is the size of the array. You can also fill this in and click the Random button to generate a random array of that size
### Sorting Options
- **Speed** - This is the speed of the sorting, you can use this to slow it down to get a good look at what is happening.
Here you can select the type of sort you want to perform or select **all** for them all to run at once.
