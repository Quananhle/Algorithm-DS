# Linked List

### Linked List Class

```Python
class LinkedListNode:
  def __init__(self, value):
      self.next = None
      self.value = value
```
- You only need a value in order to initialize a node
    * *next* and *prev* (if doubly linked-list)
- Majority of linked list coding questions is singly linked list

### Linked List: Things To Know

- All problems deal with pointer-manipulation and traversing the list
- Most problems require you to use O(1) space
- Common patterns in solving these problems:
    * Dummy-head
    * Two-pointer
    * Multi-pass

    #### Dummy-head
    
    
    #### Multi-pass
