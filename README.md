# Algorithm and Data Structures Interview Questions

## Python

#### Code: Green

1. [Missing Number](https://github.com/Quananhle/Algorithm-DS/tree/master/Python/Missing-Number): Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from ```0, 1, 2, ..., n``` find the one that is missing from the array.
2. [Single Number](https://github.com/Quananhle/Algorithm-DS/tree/master/Python/Single-Number): Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears ***twice*** except for one. Find that single one.
3. [Longest Common Prefix](https://github.com/Quananhle/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Python/Longest-Common-Prefix): Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
4. [Counting Elements](https://github.com/Quananhle/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Python/Counting-Elements): Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
5. [Add Digits](https://github.com/Quananhle/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Python/Add-Digits): Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
